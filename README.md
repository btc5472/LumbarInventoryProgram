# LumbarInventoryProgram
This program reads text from a file called "order.txt". That text file is composed of the lengths and quantities of lumbar. My program sorts the wood by putting it into a self balanced binary search tree which I programmed myself. The program is also able to search for lumbar by size. I also implemented a "garbage collection" function into this program that deletes and/or recylces old nodes from a linked list (Even though Java already has a garbage collection feature built in). The garbage collection feature was extra credit.

Things that were implemented in this program:
1) Self balancing binary search tree
2) Garbage collection feature
3) Stack
4) Linked List
5) String manipulation
